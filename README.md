# Braintrust viewers

This repository contains a few custom span iframe viewers that you can use either directly or
as starter code to create your own. Braintrust supports defining span iframes which receive
span data via URL parameters and/or iframe messages. You can embed span iframes in Braintrust
to render spans in a custom way.

For more information on how to use span iframes, see the
[Braintrust documentation](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/guides/tracing#span-iframes).

## Included viewers

- [table](./table/) a table viewer that shows span data in a table
- [x](./x) a simple viewer that shows embedded x posts (tweets).
